In order to free himself and his island, eren ends up just like reiner and kills innocent people. Now that it has been confirmed in the show that the titan shifters such as eren, annie, zeke, etc, will die after thirteen years, fans question whether the same rule applies to “normal” titans. 3 eren yeager has a titan kill count of 23 (and a lot more people) the protagonist turned antihero of the story, eren yeager, has killed just one titan in human form, but a massive 23 in total — excluding the vicious murder of the smiling titan with the voice of the founder. It only showed how not even something as horrific as the rumbling could stop the world from warring.
