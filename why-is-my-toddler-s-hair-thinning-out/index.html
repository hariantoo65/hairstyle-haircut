Why Is My Hair Thinning and What Can I Do About It From pinterest.com
Irregular patches of hair may fall out if your child twirls or pulls his hair compulsively. Tinea capitis is a type of ringworm. It’s a condition called telogen effluvium, and your hair usually grows back on its own. Traction alopecia is a form of premature hair loss that occurs when tight hair styles, such as ponytails or braids, put excess tension and stress on the scalp and hair follicles.
