His character progression drastically changed from the typical shōnen hero to a debatable villain. Eren is not supposed to be a great protagonist because he is just another victim of a world that consistently takes away his freedom. He had long, dark hair, elongated ears, small eyes, and his mouth was covered in flesh and a dark, thick beard along with black chest hair. If eren does end up continuing to play a more villainous role, i think that it�ll end with him sacrificing himself for his loved ones and/or the greater good.
