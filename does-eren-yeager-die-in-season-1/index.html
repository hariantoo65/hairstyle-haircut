Don�t die, Survive! — Eren Yeager Snk season 3 Episode 2 From aot-squad.tumblr.com
Eren has officially died, and with his death comes the end of the titan power overall (saving all of those who were forcibly transformed in the penultimate chapter). Episode 78 of the final season of attack on titan saw eren jaeger have his head blown off, but the character may not be dead for long because his brother zeke wants to use the founder�s power to. In chapter 137 they blow up eren�s titan, but that was actually a fake out, and eren transforms once more. Eren does not want to die without having accomplished anything and asks what he can do to be like reiner.
