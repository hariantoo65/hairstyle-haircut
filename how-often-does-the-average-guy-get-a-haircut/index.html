How Often Do Men Get Their Hair Cut remarkddesign From remarkddesign.blogspot.com
Yes, you can go longer if you’re letting. Typically, men should get a haircut every two to three weeks, but if you’re doing a tight fade (or something similar that needs extra detail) every two weeks should more than do the trick. The average person gets 9,672 minor injuries in a lifetime. I usually go three, but i�m pale and blond so nobody notices until my hair is wildly out of regs.
