Same Layered Shoulder Length Haircut, Different Hairstyles From latestfashiontips.com
(one to measure, one to cut) i prefer cutting my hair upside down now, and i get nice layers that way too. I say wait it out, esp if its not spilt or damaged in. A one length haircut is achieved by cutting the hair to the same perimeter length from the natural fall. I�m not exactly sure of how to even it out, but personally im not going to cut a thing!!
