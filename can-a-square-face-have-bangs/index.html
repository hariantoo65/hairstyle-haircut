Bangs can be a very good and practical option for square faces. You might have (wrongly) assumed that a pixie would make a square face look even more angular, but jennifer hudson’s soft cut proves otherwise. Square faces are identified by an equal width and height, as well as a defined jawline. Similar to rounded faces, you have to create something that blurs the angular lines of your face, so layers are going to be the key element to have the best pixie cut.
