Guys How Often Should You Get a Haircut? From liveabout.com

You can wear your front hair as long as you want, sleeked back or not, side parted, and shave your sides as deep as you feel like it, or go gradual. If you�d like your hair to grow longer, ask your stylist to trim a half an inch or less off the ends.
