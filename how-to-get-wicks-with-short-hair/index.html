The best thing about hair mods is that they’re pretty easy to install and do not cause any bugs or glitches in the game unless the modification involved is very complex. Remember, you can always add more, but it�s hard to get hair gel out of your hair without rewashing, so go easy: Eventually as time goes on they will start to congo (come together) at the root and if you leave them and don�t separate them at the root, then eventually they will form into one thicker dreadlock and grow that way, thus having that wick look. Depending on your hair type, condition, and density, it could take a couple of hours to interlock all of your hair.
