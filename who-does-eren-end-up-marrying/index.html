Who Is Mikasa Going To End Up With macbookairlaptopbag From macbookairlaptopbag.blogspot.com
As an ackerman but also as mikasa, her life revolves around eren. There�s nothing in the manga that suggests they�re even friends, let alone they�ll end up marrying. Even armin in this chapter more or less says that mikasa, while she should forget eren and move on, because he broke her heart, most likely won’t ever be able to forget eren, that’s why he punches him. The ending sequence is literally the renewal of the vows of eternal love between eren and mikasa.
