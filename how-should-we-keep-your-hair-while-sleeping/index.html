How To Prevent Hair Breakage While Sleeping Lewigs From lewigs.com
If your hair is long and you like knotting it, make sure it is not too tight as it might pull the hair strands and lead to breakage. This will help detangle your hair and evenly distribute its natural oils from the roots to ends. Applying oil to your ends will enhance your hair�s natural protection and prevent split ends from worsening while you sleep. One of the simplest ways to protect your hair at night is by brushing your strands thoroughly.
